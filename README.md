# discord-rs

discord-rs aims to be a blazingly fast library for interacting with the Discord API. It provides a simple and efficient way to build Discord bots, webhooks, create rich embeds, send messages, manage channels, and more.

# Status

discord-rs is in it's very early infancy and is not yet usable. However, I will be working eagerly to get us to a functional point. Stay tuned!
